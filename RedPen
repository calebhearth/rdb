# Redpen

Redpen is a simple way to create html from text.

## Justification

Redcloth was created because I was sick of LaTeX, writing HTML, and 
yes--Markdown. Each of these methods for creating formatted text has its
problems.

## Syntax Reference

### Emphasis

Redpen supports emphasis in the form of *bolded*, /italicized/ and _underlined_ text.

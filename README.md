RDB - Readme Driven Brainstorms
===============================

RDB is a repository of my ideas for future programming projects. Inspired the idea of [RDD] but with not
nearly enough time to sit down and write code for all of my ideas, I simply spitball ideas into a README
for the projects in potentia.

Maybe someone likes an idea? Take it. That is what open source is all about. If you see an idea and run with it,
open a ticket here to let me know. Better yet, add a section "[In Esse](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_esse)"
to the README for the idea and add a link to your project.

Don't have time to actually write the program, but have some ideas about it? Great. Me either. Fork this
repository and add your ideas. Open a pull request if you want me to include them in my originals.

Autofill.js
===========

Autofill.js is a bookmarklet which will autofill form fields with
reasonable-looking default information.

For common fields such as name, phone number, email, etc., Autofill.js will fill
in realistic filler text. Otherwise, it will fill in Lorem Ipsum-type filler
text of varying length depending on input type.

Autofill.js is smart enough to know how to fill in numeric fields and can
automatically fill in selects, checkboxes, and radio buttons.

Why do I want this?

your forms? This is for you. Otherwise, carry on with your life.
